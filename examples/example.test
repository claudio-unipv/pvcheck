# Empty lines, and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

# Non-empty lines are compared against those produced by the program
# in the corresponding section.

# equivalent).

4 05 +6

[BBB]
# For number with a fractional part, before the comparison the values
# produced by the program are rounded to the same number of fractional
# digits used in the definition of the test (two digits in the
# examples here below).

6.28

[CCC]
# In all the other cases the words composing the non-empty lines are
# compared.
abc
def


# The sepcial section ".SECTIONS" allows to specify additional options
# for the sections.  For instance, the following line indicates that
# the order of the lines in the DDD section is not relevant.  Usually
# options are declared at the beginning of the test file, or in a
# separate configuration file.
